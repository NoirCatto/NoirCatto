Combat info:

Slash can be executed with the throw button, whenever not holding anything, or whenever he has one free hand and not pressing any directional inputs. (Alternate control layout in Remix settings)

Slash has a combo mechanic.
It's damage formula is *0.2 + 0.2 * Combo multiplier*
Combo always starts at 1, and is incremented with each sucessful hit, lasting for 3 seconds.
While doing a slide, or dropping from heights, Noir gets another temporary bonus of 2.

Noir does two hits when mauling. The first hit will deal up to 50% creature's current health (depending on their bite resistance).
