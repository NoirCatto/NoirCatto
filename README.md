# Noir
This is a mod for the v1.9 version of Rain World!

Description : <br>
Noir - a quadrupedal, carnivorous slug who's based around melee combat!

Features:
- Quadrupedal movement.
- Floppy, dynamic ears
- Short range slash attack.
  It can be executed whenever not holding anything, or whenever he has one free hand and not pressing any directional inputs. (Alternate control layout in Remix settings)
- Improved mauling.
  Noir does two hits when mauling. The first hit will deal up to 50% creature's current health (depending on their bite resistance).
- Combo mechanic.
  By default, the swipe does 0.2 + 0.2 * Combo Multiplier dmg.
  Combo always starts at 1, and is incremented with each sucessful hit, lasting for 3 seconds.
  While doing a slide, or dropping from heights, he gets another temporary bonus of 2.
